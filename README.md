# Teacher Service Architecture Documentation

The documentation here uses the [C4 model][c4model] by [Simon Brown][simonbrown].
We use the [FC4 toolset][fc4-toolset] to normalise the source of C4 diagrams authored with [Structurizr Express][se].

## Structure

Teacher Services is divided into different service areas, with their respective locations in the repository:

| Service area | Location | Responsibility |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------- |
||||

## Conventions

### Colours

- Department for education software systems, people and elements use the ["Department for education" websafe colour][moj-websafe] (`#347ca9`).
- Software systems, people and elements outside the UK Government use `#28a197`.
